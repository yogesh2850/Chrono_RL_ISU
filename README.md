1. Be sure that you have installed the Anaconda Python distribution. (If you already have Python installed, you can still install Anaconda or MiniConda).
2. Add conda-forge and intel to your conda channel:
 conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge
 conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/intel
3. Do **conda install -c projectchrono pychrono**. Alternatively, use the Anaconda Navigator GUI, picking pychrono from the projectchrono channel.
